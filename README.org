* Whittle - An Emacs Package for Tidying up Cleaning Whisper Transcripts

** Overview

Whittle is an Emacs package to enhance the readability of transcripts, particularly those generated by Whisper or similar speech-to-text technologies. It declutters text by removing unnecessary filler words and correcting unintended word duplications, ensuring that the transcript is clear and true to the speaker's intended meaning.

Whittle helps ensure that your transcripts convey clarity and professionalism, retaining the essence of the spoken word in written form.
** Features

*** Remove Filler Words
Transcripts often contain filler words that can distract from the main message. Whittle efficiently identifies and removes common filler words and phrases such as "um," "uh," "you know," "kind of," "sort of," etc. This feature streamlines the transcript without altering the original intent or meaning.

*** Smart Duplicate Word Removal

The ~remove-duplicated-words~ function targets duplicated words that occur due to speech stumbles, like in "It's it's it's this entirely new way of thinking about the brain."

Some duplications are intentional for emphasis, like "really really" or "very very."

- "Yes, but does she like like him?"
- "No no no, I would never ever ever do that."
- "Please please please just this once."

Whittle intelligently excludes these from removal through a predefined list of words that are commonly used for emphasis and are thus exempt from the cleanup process: ~that, go, no, yes, very, really, so, chop, please, now, stop, sorry, never, ever, more, ha, wait, he, oh, help, hi, hello, wow, yum, yo, run, bravo, aha, long, always, tap, knock, hurry, bye, love, hate, like, way, big, best, pretty, well~.

**** Reporting
After performing the cleanup, Whittle provides a report of the changes made. It informs you which words were removed and how many times, allowing for transparency and control over the text editing process.

*** Usage
Using Whittle is straightforward:

1. Open your transcript in Emacs.
2. Run ~remove-filler-words~ to clean up filler words.
3. Execute ~remove-duplicated-words~ to eliminate unwanted repetitions.
4. Review the changes and the report provided by Whittle.

*** Example

Before Whittle:

- "Yes yes, I understand the the importance, um, of this project."
- "It's you know, um, a new um, beginning, right?"


After Whittle:

- "Yes yes, I understand the importance of this project."
- "It's a new beginning."
